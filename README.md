# waveCSS :heart:
the noxsi waveCSS Plugin for Wordpress.
Made in Stuttgart / Germany from noxsi.

## What is the plugin doing? 
This plugin allows you to create CSS classes and variables individually for each page and each post. You can create individual classes on every page or every post without them being loaded everywhere ü§ü

## Are there any requirements?
No. You do not need anything and can start right away :satisfied:.
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è You need Wordpress 3.0 or higher
```

## Let¬¥s get Started :clinking_glasses:
###### Download & Activate
Download the Plugin from the Wordpress Repository or Clone the Folder from GitHub. You can now easily install the plugin and upload it like any other plugin. After Upload activate the Plugin.

###### Use it!
After activating you see in your menu the point **"noxsi waveCSS"**.

- If you click on "CSS For Entire Website" you can edit the CSS code for the entire website. This code will be loaded on **all pages**!

- Go to a page where you want to edit your CSS. Open and Edit it.
- Scroll down to the field "waveCSS - Add Your Custom CSS, Only For This Page"
- Now in this field you can add any CSS code for this page only. The code is only loaded on **this page**, nowhere else.
- Here's a simple example:

As you can see, I add the class "test" to the HTML element <p>. I then define this in the CSS field in normal CSS syntax. The result looks like this:

Simple or? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
